// Helper functions for interface go here - callback handlers etc.
// Useful places to look for handy bits of code:
// - upload.js - file uploads, drag & drop
// - visualizers/editMetadata/editMetadata.js - saveNewVersion for creating a new version with a single changed file
//   (note that this does it with a special handler in the Java; we may need to change 2+ files so might want to do better than this!)
