# Workers should run as an unprivileged user.
#   You need to create this user manually (or you can choose a user/group combination that already exists, e.g. nobody).
#   Note that you must use the same group as the web server, since the experiment running task will try to clean up
#   temporary folders created by the backend web service when it finishes.  The easiest solution, but not necessarily
#   the most secure, is to run as the same user as the web server (shown here).  If you use a different user, you'll need
#   to ensure config.json specifies "temp_dir" as a sub-folder of /tmp, or somewhere else that doesn't have the sticky
#   bit set.
CELERYD_USER="www-data"
CELERYD_GROUP="www-data"

# If enabled pid and log directories will be created if missing,
# and owned by the userid/group configured.
